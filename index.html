        <p id="p2">
            The study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed optics. The observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows offer many clues as to the nature of light. When light interacts with matter the following occurs:
            <ul>
                <li>Absorption: energy of the light is transferred to the object</li>
                <li>Reflection: light bounces off</li>
                <li>Transmission: light goes through the object.</li>	
            </ul>
            Light or visible light is an electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum that is perceived by the human eye. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range 400-700 nanometers (nm), between infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).
            The speed of light is 300,000km/s in space. This means a frequency range of roughly 430-750 terahertz (THz).
            Properties of Light
            The primary properties of light are:
            <ol>
                <li>Intensity</li>
                <li>Propagation-direction</li>
                <li>Frequency</li>
                <li>Speed</li>
                <li>Wavelength spectrum</li>
                <li>Polarization</li>
            </ol>
